# Calculator App

This project is part of the 3mtt Software Development Programme on the Darey.io platform. The objective of this mini-project is to build a simple Calculator App using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The application allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

## Project Objective

The goal of this project is to create a functional calculator that provides a clean and intuitive user interface. It demonstrates the integration of HTML for structure, CSS for styling (ensuring responsiveness and visual appeal), and JavaScript for functionality. This project is designed to showcase fundamental web development skills and problem-solving abilities.

## Use Case

A user (e.g., a student or a potential employer) visits the calculator app to perform simple arithmetic calculations quickly. They can:
- Input numbers by clicking on digit buttons.
- Choose an arithmetic operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division).
- Compute the result by pressing the equal button.
- Reset the calculator using the clear button.
This application serves as a demonstration of combining front-end technologies to build interactive and user-friendly web tools.

## Project Overview

The Calculator App consists of:
- **A Display Screen:** Shows the current input and computed results.
- **Digit Buttons (0-9):** Allow users to enter numbers.
- **Operation Buttons:** Include addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/).
- **A Clear Button:** Resets the calculator.
- **An Equal Button:** Computes and displays the result.

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3 (responsive design implemented via basic grid techniques)
- JavaScript (to handle functionality and interactivity)
